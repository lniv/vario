BOM

The following components were used - initially on a protoboard, moved onto a soldered setup. This is not the cheapest or smallest way to use the underlying components, but the point was to use a building block approach and avoid any surface mount soldering, or creating PCBs (though assembling all of these using 30 awg wire, as i've done, does resemble a rats nest - i will try to create a pcb for easily connecting all of these)

Adafruit 

1 x Teensy 3.1 + header[ID:1625] = $19.95
1 x Adafruit 10-DOF IMU Breakout - L3GD20H + LSM303 + BMP180[ID:1604] = $29.95
1 x Adafruit Mono 2.5W Class D Audio Amplifier - PAM8302[ID:2130] = $3.95
1 x Mini Metal Speaker w/ Wires - 8 ohm 0.5W[ID:1890] = $3.00
1 x Automotive Gauge Stepper Motor (x27.168) [ID:2424] = $9.95
1 x Adafruit TB6612 1.2A DC/Stepper Motor Driver Breakout Board[ID:2448] = $4.95

modern device -  Pressure Sensor (MPXV) (#MD0590) (honeywell MPXV7007DP) 14$
2 x 10K resistors (for MPXV7007DP voltage divider) - should be 1% or better.

Sparkfun:
1 x LS20031 gps module [Sparkfun GPS-08975] = 59.95$

1 x MS-5611 breakout module GY-63 [dealextreme #148866, numerous sources exist] = 14.35$

Notes:
currently the code does not use the gps (apart from forwarding it to the navigation computer), the diff pressure module (ditto - it does calculate airspeed, but does not use it for vario) and imu. Hence, a simpler BMP180 breakout board can be used and the gps and diff pressure modules can be dropped, or only the MS-5611 breakout module can be used (dropping gps, imu)
